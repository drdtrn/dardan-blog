        <p>-My name is Dardan TÃ«rnava. I come from Kosovo, a small country in Balkan-Europe. I attended the high school of medicine and after graduating I continued pursuing Medicine studies - General Medicine branch on the "State University of Tetova" in North Macedonia on 2018.</p>
        <p>-During my studies I've developed a liking to programming also and started learning bit by bit through different online courses and e-books focusing more, but not only on software and back-end developing. During my learning of programming, I codded up this blog site which I intend to use for publishing different facts and advices about general health as I advance on my studies and maybe on other fields also.</p>
        <p>-Feel free to write your feedback on the comments or directly to me on my social media.</p>
